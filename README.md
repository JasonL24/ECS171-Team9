# ECS 171 Group 9: Music Synth
Composing music is hard, especially for people who have no experience in the field of music. 
Therefore, we came up with the idea to let computers compose music for us. The project is to create a web application 
that uses our machine learning algorithm to generate simple music melodies. The user can specify the theme of their music, 
and give ratings based on the music generated.

## GitHub Commit Guidelines
1. **Never push directly push to master**
   - If you are working on a feature, create a branch, work on the branch, then create a pull request when you are done.
   - Force pushing could cause us to lose data.
2. Make sure you use .gitignore to discard configuration folders
   - Folders such as .idea/ are configuration folders, they are not actual code.
   - Remove all configuration folders before committing and pushing.
3. Always write good comment, and update README so others can correctly setup the environment
4. It's ok to have a lot of commits

*will update as we go*
