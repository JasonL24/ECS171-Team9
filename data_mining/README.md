# How to: Data Mine
The first thing is you never upload any data to GitHub (etc MID files, parsed MIDI files)


## Installation
Here are a few pacakges you are going to need right now (Will update as we go).

1. `pip install music21`

## File Structure
Since we will be opening files in folders. It will probably be easier if we use similar file structure so we can have
matching relative path.
